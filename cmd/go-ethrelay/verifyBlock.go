// verifyBlockCmd represents the block command
// TODO: this command only compares the hashes and checks for existence on the respective chain, not for equality
//  even though a tampering is hard to achieve, this does not mean the blocks are equal
// 	another unlikely misbehaviour of this command is occurs if one tries to verify a block to kick off a dispute
// 	- here it is possible that a block is valid on the destination chain and can't be disputed by participants,
//  however, this would means that an "attacker" can produce blocks in a faster way than the source blockchain
//  and is for that reason very unlikely
